I built a responsive inventory management system using Core Java, JDBC, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system efficiently tracks material issuance, updates inventory, monitors raw material availability, and includes approval workflows for material issuance by the head. All processes are streamlined for effective management.
